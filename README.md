# NodeBB Unresponsive Plugin

The NodeBB Unresponsive Plugin is a way to allow users to prevent NodeBB's responsive design from causing unexpected changes
in the UI when using NodeBB. The user's preference is stored using the browser's local storage, so it is specific to 
the device being used to access NodeBB.
